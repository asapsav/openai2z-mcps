## TODOs

### ✅ Satellite imagery and map sources:
- [ ] **Google Earth Engine (GEE):** one‑click access to Sentinel‑1/‑2, NICFI, GEDI, SRTM, and Landsat.
- [ ] **European Space Agency:** a surplus of incredible open-source data collected over the last decades.
- [ ] **NASA:** The NASA catalogue is open to use and home to 25,000+ data sets.
- [ ] **OpenTopography LiDAR:** High-res canopy-penetrating elevation (1–10 m).
- [ ] **Sentinel‑2 optical imagery:** 10 m, 13-band scenes (good for vegetation scars).
- [ ] **AWS CLI:** covers swaths of western Amazon.

### ✅ Archaeological point data:
- [ ] **The Archeo Blog:** shares sampled data already drawn from the Amazonian region.
